### Recursion

- What is a call stack?
- What is an execution context?
- What is the 'base case' in recursion?
- What is the 'recursive step' in recursion?
- What is Big O Notation?

Make the following text easier to understand:

'In a recursive function, the “counting variable” equivalent is the argument to the recursive call. If we’re counting down to 0, for example, our base case would be the function call that receives 0 as an argument. We might design a recursive step that takes the argument passed in, decrements it by one, and calls the function again with the decremented argument. In this way, we would be moving towards 0 as our base case.'

- What is the difference between a stack overflow and a stack underflow?
- What is a queue overflow and what is a queue underflow, and what is the difference between them?
- What is the 'recursive case'?
- Do some practice drills on recursion.
